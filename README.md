### NGU Script
This is a learning project in my Rust journey. 

The objective of this script is to automate the playing of an incremental game called [NGU](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147690/NGU_IDLE/).

NGU is a complex game with many unwrapping features and requires user input to play optimally. 
This is a fresh take, now with Rust.
Note that this is still under active development, and is not meant to be used by the public.

- Some years ago I wrote a [similar script](https://github.com/mdacach/ngu_script_python) with Python.
- Back then I had the help of a discord user called Satyric, which also wrote a (much better) [script](https://github.com/kujan/NGU-scripts).
